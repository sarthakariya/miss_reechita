            <h3>My World</h3>
            <p>I'm Sarthak, and I'm passionate about a lot of things, from coding complex projects to exploring new places. But above all, I cherish the connections I make and the laughter I share with those closest to me.</p>

            <p>I love spending my time learning new skills, whether it's a new programming language, or understanding the intricacies of human connection. Every day is an opportunity to grow and to appreciate the beauty around me.</p>
