        <p>Reechita, after that little invitation, here we are! Every single moment since you walked into my life has been a gift, a vibrant brushstroke on the canvas of my world. This page is a little glimpse into how our story unfolded, leading me to this very special point.</p>
        <p>From the silly inside jokes to the quiet moments of understanding, every memory is a treasure that has shaped who I am today. You've taught me so much, inspired me endlessly, and made me believe in a love I once only dreamed of.</p>
